# PhysAstroNotes
A compilation of notes, homeworks and assigments of topics related to physics, astronomy and astrophysics. Most of them are in Spanish. If you find something useful, please use it appropriately, in case you find mistakes or typos you can notify me. Have Fun!

**Disclaimer:** Please consider that, given these notes are part of my courses, and although I checked and I uploaded the reviewed versions, it is possible that some results or information may be wrong or misleading, so be careful. I'm constantly updating them by uploading clean LaTeX versions. Nevertheless, these notes should be taken merely as a studying guide or complemental material. I'm working on the English version too.
